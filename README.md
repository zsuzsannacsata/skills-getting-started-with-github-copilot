   </a>

2. In the new tab, most of the fields will automatically fill in for you.

   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will use [Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.

3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds for the exercise to be prepared and buttons updated. You will continue working from your copy of the exercise.

   - The **Copy Exercise** button will deactivate, changing to gray.
   - The **Start Exercise** button will activate, changing to green.
   - You will likely need to refresh the page.

4. Click **Start Exercise**. Follow the step-by-step instructions and feedback will be provided as you progress.
